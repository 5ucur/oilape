Some Greasemonkey scripts of mine.

Any of them might break at any time in the future, and there's absolutely no warranty for any script's functionality. They worked when I uploaded them, they might break the next hour even. I'm mainly uploading them here as a backup, as I don't consider them worthy of sharing on any Greasemonkey script sharing page. If you decide to upload them somewhere, a link back or crediting me would be appreciated.

## Script list and descriptions (alphabetical order)

- **[DrawShieldDrawCommand](/Scripts/DrawShieldDrawCommand.js)**
  - Adds the functionality of pressing `Ctrl + Enter` on the DrawShield create page to draw the coat of arms, instead of clicking the "Draw Shield" button.
  - Useful for higher productivity, letting you use your mouse less.
- **[GoogleFocusSearchbarImagesVideos](/Scripts/GoogleFocusSearchbarImagesVideos)**
  - Adds the functionality of pressing `/` to focus the search bar in Image and Video searches, just like in the general "All" search.
  - Useful for quick search bar focusing while searching images or videos, in case you're used to using `/` like I am and don't feel like reaching for the mouse or furiously spamming (Shift +) Tab.
- **[GoogleImagesAddGameplay](/Scripts/GoogleImagesAddGameplay)**
  - Adds a button to add " gameplay" to a Google image search. Does nothing if the query already ends with " gameplay".
  - Useful for that annoying fact that videogame image searches tend to show box art.
- **[GoToExplainXKCD](/Scripts/GoToExplainXKCD)**
  - Adds a button to [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/) comic pages that leads to the unofficial wiki for the page.
  - Useful when you just don't get Randall Munroe's latest illustration, and don't feel like reaching for the keyboard.
- **[MinecraftWikiRedirect](/Scripts/MinecraftWikiRedirect)**
  - Autoredirects from a Fandom Minecraft wiki page, to a minecraft.wiki one. The Fandom page will still technically be visited.
  - Useful if you misclick or are linked to a Fandom page.
- **[OldRedditJustThePost](/Scripts/OldRedditJustThePost)**
  - Adds a button to write the title and content of a Reddit post (old reddit only) to a blank page. A single image post will retain its image; a gallery post will retain the currently visible image, or the gallery itself if currently visible, but it will not be interactive. The current URL is kept, meaning that to go back to normal view, you reload the page.
  - Useful for reading a larger post as the text can take up the whole page's width. The text is also larger.
- **[YouTubeCustomSpeed](/Scripts/YouTubeCustomSpeed)**
  - Adds a button to YouTube, which adds a custom speed slider (1-5 range, 0.1 increments).
  - Useful for going through a video faster than what video controls let you.
