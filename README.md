Some Greasemonkey scripts of mine.

Any of them might break at any time in the future, and there's absolutely no warranty for any script's functionality. They worked when I uploaded them, they might break the next hour even. I'm mainly uploading them here as a backup, as I don't consider them worthy of sharing on any Greasemonkey script sharing page. If you decide to upload them somewhere, please link back here.

## Script list and descriptions (alphabetical order)
Click on the name of a script to be taken directly to the file! Files with a strikethrough ~~like so~~ are deprecated or not recommended.

- **[DrawShieldDrawCommand](/Scripts/DrawShieldDrawCommand.js)**
  - Adds the functionality of pressing `Ctrl + Enter` on the DrawShield create page to draw the coat of arms, instead of clicking the "Draw Shield" button.
  - Useful for higher productivity, letting you use your mouse less.
  - See also the DrawShield [website](https://drawshield.net) and the DrawShield [GitHub organisation page](https://github.com/drawshield/).
- **[DrawShieldFocusCatalogSearch](/Scripts/DrawShieldFocusCatalogSearch.js)**
  - Autofocuses the search box on the DrawShield catalog page.
  - Useful for higher productivity, letting you search the catalog immediately as well as bringing focus closer to the section headers so you can tab to them quickly, too.
- ~~**[GNUTerryPratchett](/Scripts/GNUTerryPratchett.js)**~~
  - Adds a footer to any site that has `GNU Terry Pratchett` in its headers (specifically `x-clacks-overhead`). Read more [here](http://gnuterrypratchett.com/) and [here](https://xclacksoverhead.org/). Read about Terry [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pratchett).
  - Inspired by some addons that were supposed to notify about these headers in some way, that I could not get to work.
  - Breaks on some pages, not displaying as a footer, so it's removable by simply clicking on it.
  - Good for any fan of the man or his works. But it seems it breaks on *many* pages so ***I recommend against actually using this script***.
  - > "A man is not dead while his name is still spoken."           
â€” Going Postal, Chapter 4 prologue [](GNU_Terry_Pratchett)
- **[GoogleFocusSearchbarImagesVideos](/Scripts/GoogleFocusSearchbarImagesVideos.js)**
  - Adds the functionality of pressing `/` to focus the search bar in Image and Video searches, just like in the general "All" search.
  - Useful for quick search bar focusing while searching images or videos, in case you're used to using `/` like I am and don't feel like reaching for the mouse or furiously spamming (Shift +) Tab.
- **[GoogleImagesAddGameplay](/Scripts/GoogleImagesAddGameplay.js)**
  - Adds a button to add " gameplay" to a Google image search. Does nothing if the query already ends with " gameplay".
  - Useful for that annoying fact that videogame image searches tend to show box art.
- **[GoToExplainXKCD](/Scripts/GoToExplainXKCD.js)**
  - Adds a button to [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/) comic pages that leads to the unofficial wiki for the page.
  - Useful when you just don't get Randall Munroe's latest illustration, and don't feel like reaching for the keyboard.
- ~~**[MinecraftWikiRedirect](/Scripts/MinecraftWikiRedirect.js)**~~
  - ***Do not use. Instead use [this extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/new-minecraft-wiki-redirect/) by lordofpipes ([source code](https://github.com/lordofpipes/new-minecraft-wiki-redirect)), which skips even loading the Fandom page.***
  - Autoredirects from a Fandom Minecraft wiki page, to a minecraft.wiki one. The Fandom page will still technically be visited.
  - Useful if you misclick or are linked to a Fandom page.
- **[OldRedditJustThePost](/Scripts/OldRedditJustThePost.js)**
  - Adds a button to write the title and content of a Reddit post (old reddit only) to a blank page.
  - A single image post will retain its image.
  - A gallery post will retain the currently visible image, or the gallery itself if currently visible, but it will not be interactive.
  - The current URL is kept, meaning that to go back to normal view, you reload the page.
  - Useful for reading a larger post as the text can take up the whole page's width. The text is also larger.
- **[YouTubeCustomSpeed](/Scripts/YouTubeCustomSpeed.js)**
  - Adds a button to YouTube, which adds a custom speed slider (1-5 range, 0.1 increments).
  - Useful for going through a video faster than what video controls let you.
